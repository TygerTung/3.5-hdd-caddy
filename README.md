This is a laser cut HDD caddy for mounting external drives. The drawings are for 3mm acrylic, however the acrylic is typically 0.1mm less than 3mm. If it is more than 3mm, the finger joints will not work.
There are two versions; one for a standard 80mm cooling fan, and one version for a recycled fan from a graphics card. The GPU fan design is for three equally spaced mounting holes at 40mm centres. The hole is 2.5mm which allows for tapping to M3.
The caddies are designed to hold 5 hard drives, have screw holes to mount them in place, and could potentially be stacked, although it may become a little unstable.

I have used recycled acrylic for mine from abandoned projects, hence the multicoloured nature, with existing paterns on the plastic. You could also use 3mm MDF.

If you do not have access to a laser cutter, many public libraries now have them, if you are at a intermediate or high school, or have a child at one, many of these now have laser cutters. There are also often maker spaces in many municipalities which may be accessed.
